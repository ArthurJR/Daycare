<p>Infant</p>

The infant class is a place for our youngest students to start their development path. With a low ratio of students to teachers, individual attention is constantly giving to your child throughout the day. “Tummy Time”, trust building exercises, and environment discovery is explored here. Soothing music is played throughout the day and a flexible feeding, nap, and changing schedule caters to you and your child’s needs. Very detailed daily sheets are filled out and drop off and continue through to pick up.
